# crabmeyerpy
Python routines for the Meyer et al. (2010) Crab nebula constant B-field model in 1D and 3D. 
Also includes routines to calculate the emission in the Kennel & Coroniti (1984) MHD flow model solution. 

All models assume time independence and spherical symmetry. 

If you want to use the fast routines for the 3D model calculations, you need to install numba 
and the fast interp package: https://github.com/dbstein/fast_interp
