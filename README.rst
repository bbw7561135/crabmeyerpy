crabmeyerpy
===========

Python routines for the Meyer et al. (2010) Crab nebula constant B-field model in 1D and now in 3D. 
Also includes routines to calculate the emission in the Kennel & Coroniti (1984) MHD flow model solution. 

All models assume time independence and spherical symmetry. 

Prerequisites
-------------

Python 3.6 or higher and the following packages
    - numpy 
    - scipy
    - astropy
    - numba

If you want to use the fast routines for the 3D model calculations, you need to install numba 
and the fast interp package: https://github.com/dbstein/fast_interp
